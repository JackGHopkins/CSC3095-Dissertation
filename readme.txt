# CSC3095-Dissertation

CSC3095 Dissertation : April 2021 - May 2021

What was the development environment used for your program?
I programed this at home during lockdown in the Pandemic. It is my Bachelor degree's dissertation Project.

Used OS: Windows 10

Used Library/Middleware: N/A

Used Engine: Unity 2020.1.8f

Used Development Environment: Visual Studio Community 2019 | Version 16.3.7

## Why did you create this program?
It was a demonstration for my Bachelor degree's dissertation project. It was designed to measure the speed and memory efficiency of 4 different types of flood fill algorithm.
This includes: 
- a brute force method.
- a four way method.
- a span fill method.
- a walk-based method.
I also included an algorithm that found the perimeters of the shapes. The aim of this project was to see if I could create settlements from colour-coded diagrams, in an effort to reduce development time while still maintaining a good amount of creative control.

## What were you careful about?
I was careful not to overdesign the demonstration as it was meant to be a first step and not a final product. I needed to make sure I understood and implemented the algorithms correctly and not lead to unnecessary bloat while also testing as many possible scenarios as possible. 

## What did you find difficult?
The walk-based algorithm was the most difficult since its pseudo code was the hardest to understand and the most complex. Furthermore, the pseudo code contained many while loops, thus it was quite difficult to debug.

## What points do you want us particularly focus on your work?
The implementation of the algorithms. Despite finding a way to piece them all together in an easily usable structure, it was not my main focus. The algorithms, however, were my main focus. I spent most of my time trying to implement them properly.

## If you took some source codes as reference, what part of them did you use? Please also tell us the filename of that part.
Not applicable. I did not use any source code.

## If you are using a library or function created by someone else, please put those parts in a separate file and write the corresponding filename.
Also, not applicable.
